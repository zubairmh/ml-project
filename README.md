# Dark Pattern Text Classification

This project focuses on detecting dark patterns in e-commerce text using various machine learning models. Dark patterns exploit psychological biases to manipulate users, often leading to unethical practices like forced actions, unauthorized subscriptions, and misleading advertisements. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, this project aims to provide an automated and user-friendly solution for identifying these deceptive practices.


## Features

- Automated Dark Pattern Detection: Identify deceptive text patterns in e-commerce content.
- Machine Learning Models: Compare the performance of classifiers including:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)
  - Complement Naive Bayes (CMNB)
  - Random Forest
  - Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)
  - BERT

- Metrics Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, and F1 score for model comparisons.
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, vectorization, and data cleaning for high-quality feature extraction.
